<h3>SECTION 1: PORTS</h3>
<p>
    Port Format
    All ports will be named in this format:
    
    [DIR][TYPE]-[#PORTS][ROLE]
    
    How the format works:
    
    [DIR] > Can be either an Input, Output, or Bidirectional port (Labelled I, O or B) Bidirectional port holes don’t exist for redstone ports yet, but do for item ports.
    [TYPE] > BIN (Binary) / HEX (Hexadecimal)
    [#PORTS] > The number of ports it has, as a number. If it only has 1 port, you don’t have to include this tag! (e.g. Just BIN instead of BIN-1)
    [ROLE] > Most ports will be SD (Standard), but ports with specific roles will have different colors and have a different named tag. For example, HEX-STATE. If the port is SD you don’t have to include this tag! (e.g. just HEX instead of HEX-SD)
    Redstone Port Types
    Each port would have a corresponding colored concrete block under it.
    Locations of the port holes are in (X, Y), in which (1, 1) is the bottom left block on a 16x16 face looking from the side of a chunk. (Clarification: Port HOLES, not the concrete position)
    Some ports are “dangerously incompatible,” meaning the port’s position overlaps with a different, more prioritized port(s), which can cause issues when next to these ports.
    <h5>BIN</h5>
    
    Color: 🟥 Red Concrete
    Location: IBIN at (7, 2) – OBIN at (10, 2)
    The default port. Used to connect components together, and is the simplest port (as it does not preserve signal strength). These are made for speed.
    <h5>HEX</h5>
    
    Color: 🟦 Blue Concrete (To clarify, REGULAR BLUE, not light blue)
    Location: IHEX at (5, 2) – OHEX at (12, 2)
    A more advanced port. They preserve the signal strength from the output of the previous block. Useful for HEX calculations.
    Recommended to have IHEX next to an IBIN to ensure compatibility with other components (IBIN would set the input on that side to 15 or 0 to convert it to HEX)
    <h5>HEX-STATE </h5>

Color: 🟩 Green Concrete
Location: IHEX-STATE at (5, 4) – OHEX-STATE at (12, 4)
(Under development) Used to check the state of a component which is currently doing an operation. The component can decide what signal strength each state is. If a component decides multiple states counts as the same value it should pulse when changing between them to indicate the state has changed (But try avoid having multiple states output the same thing). (Examples: A comparator could return the value of the state; an observer can “observe” the state to know if it has changed). You could use this output to make your bigstone circuit do certain things!
<h5>HEX-2</h5>

Color: 🟨 Yellow Concrete
Locations: IHEX-2 at (7, 6) and (9, 6), OHEX-2 at (8, 6) and (10, 6)
Just like HEX, but carries double the amount of data, meaning it can carry 8 bits (1 byte) of data!</p>
<h5>BIN-LR</h5>

Color: 🟦 Cyan Concrete
Locations IBIN-LR at (2, 3) for 1st bit, and stack upwards for every additional bit e.g. (4, 3), (6, 3) and so on, up to 8 bits (e.g. BIN-8LR). OBIN-LR at (14, 3) for 1st bit, and stack upwards again.
Useful for computational components, especially since most computational circuits are vertical, so you can easily plug it right in!
<h5>BIN-8</h5>

NOTE: This is being discontinued since it has dangerous conflict, and a better one exists now called BIN-LR. Please use that for all future builds when possible!

⚠️ Dangerously incompatible next to: 🟥BIN, 🟦HEX, 🟦BIN-LR, 🟫RAIL (wow that’s a lot)

Color: 🟧 Orange Concrete
Locations: Coming soon
Carrys 8 bits of data, but is huge, so a wire can only be one way. However, it can be useful for speed over a long distance of wires, and can also save space within a component since you don’t need to fit a HEX decoder inside your components if it uses BIN-8 instead.
<h5>RAIL</h5>

WARNING: Make sure you put these next to components that use the same type of minecart. Otherwise minecart types can mix and cause issues.

Color: 🟫 Brown Concrete
Locations: IRAIL at (8, 2) – ORAIL at (9, 2)
The IRAIL is regular rail, and ORAIL is powered rail. This port can be used to transfer items (or mobs/players) using minecarts.
